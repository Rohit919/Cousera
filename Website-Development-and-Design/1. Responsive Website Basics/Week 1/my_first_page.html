        <br>
        <p>The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin [ˈvʲjɛ̇ʥ̑mʲĩn]) is an action role-playing game developed by 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt#CD_Projekt_Red" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red </a>and published by Atari, based on the novel series of The Witcher by 
            Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.
            The story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows Geralt of Rivia, 
            one of a few traveling monster hunters who have supernatural powers, known as Witchers. 
            The game's system of moral choices as part of the storyline was noted for its time-delayed 
            consequences and lack of black-and-white morality.</p>
